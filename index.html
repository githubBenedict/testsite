    <h1>Hello and welcome to this website which represents a UK political party website called NewQE.</h1>
        <p>The aim of this project is to force the Bank of England when it conducts quantitative easing, that the money is given directly to UK citizens to spend and use as they see fit.</p>
        <p>Currently, the Bank of England purchases Corporate Bonds and adds them to its balance sheet. Then it will discard these into the UK financial markets and destroy the proceeds of the sale. This is called quantitative easing and has been a financial precedent that has existed for some time.</p>
        <p>For the first time in a while, the US government passed a bill that meant that US citizens would be entitled to "stimulus" cheques, titled as a consequence of the sufferings of being locked down and the economy being hit so hard.</p>
        <p>Now we have rising inflation and a growing public sector and we need to try something new.</p>
        <p>So, please add your name below to receive a newsletter and updates about the project. My name is Benedict Kemp and I am the founder of this site and this movement. Please put your vote of confidence on the register by submitting your details and I look forward to being in contact with you.</p>
